(per Scientific American, 6/10/2009)"

    "#1055: The life expectancy of cats has nearly doubled since 1930 - from 8 to 16 years."
    "#1056: Cats have been domesticated for half as long as dogs have been."
    "#1057: Diet, Health, and Behavior"
    "#1058: Cats respond most readily to names that end in an \"ee\" sound."
    "#1059: The female cat reaches sexual maturity within 6 to 10 months; most veterinarians suggest spaying the female at 5 months, before her first heat period. The male cat usually reaches sexual maturity between 9 and 12 months."
    "#1060: Female cats are \"polyestrous,\" which means they may have many heat periods over the course of a year. A heat period lasts about 4 to 7 days if the female is bred; if she is not, the heat period lasts longer and recurs at regular intervals."
    "#1061: A female cat will be pregnant for approximately 9 weeks - between 62 and 65 days from conception to delivery."
    "#1062: Female felines are \"superfecund,\" which means that each of the kittens in her litter can have a different father."
    "#1063: Many cats love having their forehead gently stroked."
    "#1064: If a cat is frightened, put your hand over its eyes and forehead, or let him bury his head in your armpit to help calm him."
    "#1065: A cat will tremble or shiver when it is in extreme pain."
    "#1066: Cats should not be fed tuna exclusively, as it lacks taurine, an essential nutrient required for good feline health."
    "#1067: Purring does not always indicate that a cat is happy and healthy - some cats will purr loudly when they are terrified or in pain."
    "#1068: Not every cat gets \"high\" from catnip. If the cat doesn't have a specific gene, it won't react (about 20% do not have the gene). Catnip is non-addictive."

    "#1076: Cats can jump up to 7 times their tail length."
    "#1077: Spaying a female before her first or second heat will greatly reduce the threat of mammary cancer and uterine disease. A cat does not need to have at least 1 litter to be healthy, nor will they \"miss\" motherhood. A tabby named \"Dusty\" gave birth to 420 documented kittens in her lifetime, while \"Kitty\" gave birth to 2 kittens at the age of 30, having given birth to a documented 218 kittens in her lifetime."
    "#1078: Neutering a male cat will, in almost all cases, stop him from spraying (territorial marking), fighting with other males (at least over females), as well as lengthen his life and improve its quality."
    "#1079: Declawing a cat is the same as cutting a human's fingers off at the knuckle. There are several alternatives to a complete declawing, including trimming or a less radical (though more involved) surgery to remove the claws. Instead, train your cat to use a scratching post."
    "#1080: The average lifespan of an outdoor-only (feral and non-feral) is about 3 years; an indoor-only cat can live 16 years and longer. Some cats have been documented to have a longevity of 34 years."
    "#1081: Cats with long, lean bodies are more likely to be outgoing, and more protective and vocal than those with a stocky build."
    "#1082: A steady diet of dog food may cause blindness in your cat - it lacks taurine."
    "#1083: An estimated 50% of today's cat owners never take their cats to a veterinarian for health care. Too, because cats tend to keep their problems to themselves, many owners think their cat is perfectly healthy when actually they may be suffering from a life-threatening disease. Therefore, cats, on an average, are much sicker than dogs by the time they are brought to your veterinarian for treatment."
    "#1084: Never give your cat aspirin unless specifically prescribed by your veterinarian; it can be fatal. Never ever give Tylenol to a cat.  And be sure to keep anti-freeze away from all animals - it's sweet and enticing, but deadly poison.

    "#1095: Contrary to popular belief, people are not allergic to cat fur, dander, saliva, or urine - they are allergic to \"sebum,\" a fatty substance secreted by the cat's sebaceous glands. More interesting, someone who is allergic to one cat may not be allergic to another cat. Though there isn't (yet) a way of predicting which cat is more likely to cause allergic reactions, it has been proven that male cats shed much greater amounts of allergen than females. A neutered male, however, sheds much less than a non-neutered male."

    "#1105: Cat litter was \"invented\" in 1947 when Edward Lowe asked his neighbor to try a dried, granulated clay used to sop up grease spills in factories. (In 1990, Mr. Lowe sold his business for $200 million.)  Related page:  Other Things You Can Do with Kitty Litter"
