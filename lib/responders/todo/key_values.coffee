# It seems like it might be nice to tell the bot to remember things for a given room -- sort of like a documentation tool for peoples phone numbers, server information, links to various tools etc.
# Ideas
#   bot, store "key" with "value"
#   bot, remember "key" with "value"
#   bot, keep "value" for "key" on file.
#   bot, note "key", "value".
